<h1>Monte Carlo Simulation</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
In many areas of experimental, computational and theoretical physics it is desirable to produce stochastic computer models of an experimental setup (including measurement errors) or a physical entity (such as a galaxy or star). Such models are called Monte Carlo simulations because they are non-deterministic, and therefore model real-life processes more closely.
